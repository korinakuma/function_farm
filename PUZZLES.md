# Here are some puzzles! YAY 

Requirements for Puzzles: 
- Each puzzle can be solved by providing up to three arguments to a function to solve a puzzle 
- Each puzzle will show the body of a function, but the player cannot change the body of the function. 
- Most puzzles should only ask for primitive values for the arguments. Only strings, booleans, and numbers. 



## Puzzle One

Some of the sheep have escaped their pens! We have a function called `move_all_sheep` which takes two arguments: x and y, and moves all sheep by those thingies. Make sure that all sheep are in their pens, and that you haven't moved any sheep that were in the pen, out of the pen. 

## Puzzle Two

One of the sheep is extra tricky, and you need to move only that sheep into the pen. We have a function called `move_one_sheep_by_name`, which takes a name string, and x and y parameters to move the sheep.
